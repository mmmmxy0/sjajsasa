                                            <P>Afidus authorised distributor O2O announced its collaboration with YUESION  Construction Co., ltd. to formally install two Afidus ATL230 professional AI construction Time Lapse cameras at the hazardous old building reconstruction site on Ershizhang Road, Xindian District, New Taipei City.

This initiative not only represents a significant demonstration project for YUESION in Xindian but also showcases the innovative application of Time Lapse technology within hazardous old building reconstruction.
                                                Smart Choice: ATL230 Takes Centre Stage
                                                The Afidus ATL230 selected by YUESION boasts multiple professional-grade features. Firstly, its intelligent, user-centric design incorporates ‘wireless, ladder-free’ operation, enabling users to monitor and adjust shooting parameters in real-time via a dedicated app, significantly reducing on-site maintenance risks. The waterproof, monocoque body design ensures long-term outdoor durability without requiring additional waterproof casings. Secondly, the ATL230 incorporates a Sony starlight-grade sensor with 3x optical zoom, supports 1080p high-definition recording, and delivers up to 210 days of continuous operation per charge. Combined with intelligent power management and mobile power solutions, it can reliably support the entire three-year construction period.
                                                Reliable Technology, Field-Tested Across Multiple Sites
                                                Afidus equipment has been extensively deployed in major projects such as the Xindian Shisizhang History Park and Taoyuan Airport's Third Runway. Its ‘image comparison anti-drift’ function automatically detects lens displacement, ensuring consistent footage. Installed at the site's highest vantage points and access points, the cameras provide comprehensive progress monitoring. Complemented by app tutorials, they enable the YUESION team to remotely configure filming schedules, schedule battery and memory card replacements, perform cloud backups, and secure optimal angles via parapet wall clamps and C-channel steel mounting.
                                                Visual Value: A New Tool for Hazardous Building Reconstruction
                                                YUESION Development has long been renowned for its ‘full-project management’ approach. The introduction of Time Lapse photography not only comprehensively documents construction details but also transforms this footage into brand marketing material, strengthening public trust in hazardous building reconstruction. For the client, Time Lapse imagery serves not merely as documentation but as a vital tool for conveying corporate professionalism and responsibility.
                                                Conclusion
                                                Technology merges with engineering, making ‘time’ the most compelling narrator. The Afidus ATL230, with its intelligent design, extended battery life, and professional-grade imaging quality, delivers world-class documentation standards for the ‘YUESION Jingxuan’ project. Over the next three years, every transformation of this hazardous old building site will be perfectly preserved through Time Lapse imagery, leaving an eternal testament to the birth of Xindian's new landmark.

                                            <P>Carrying out large-scale projects in prime urban locations presents not only technical construction challenges but also the professional task of consistently capturing high-quality documentation throughout the entire process. Today, Afidus, in collaboration with Yuan-Yang Construction Co., Ltd., officially introduced the Afidus ATL230 professional Time Lapse cameras at the Far Eastern Department Store Baoqing Redevelopment Project on Zhonghua Road in Taipei. Over the course of the 52-month construction timeline, the cameras will provide uninterrupted, world-class visual documentation.
                                                <br><B>Key Challenges – Clear Project Pain Points</B>
                                                Located in the heart of Taipei, surrounded by multiple high-rise buildings and adjacent to residential areas, the project posed strict requirements from the client: “non-invasive installation” and “no reliance on city power.” With fixed rental points for equipment placement, it was also critical to ensure a consistent viewpoint over a long period of time while maintaining clear and stable imagery through typhoon seasons and rainy weather.
                                                <br><br><B>Afidus ATL230 Solutions</B>
                                                <br>To meet these challenges, Afidus delivered a comprehensive solution:
                                                <br>• Extended Power Endurance: Four AA alkaline batteries can support up to seven months of operation, eliminating the need for external power supplies.
                                                <br>• Non-Invasive Installation: Custom gravity clamps allow mounting directly on parapet walls without drilling, preserving building integrity.

                                            <P>With the increasing popularity of public works projects, 4K time-lapse
                                                photography has become the latest focus, and the ATL-800 4K project
                                                Timelapse Camera has attracted a great deal of attention in the video
                                                industry in the past year since its launch. In the past, it was commonly
                                                used in private construction projects, but this year, it has started to
                                                gradually enter into the scenes of public projects, such as
                                                the National Palace Museum, Taoyuan Airport T3 Terminal Office Building,
                                                etc., and the use of Kaohsiung Jiu Ru Bridge demolition project has
                                                demonstrated the trend of popularization of 4K time-lapse photography.
                                                This project is especially noteworthy. In addition to purchasing the
                                                ATL-800 project version of the Timelapse Camera, the customer also
                                                purchased a special 4x power USB waterproof battery box kit made by
                                                O2O, which contains a number of original Panasonic 18650 lithium
                                                batteries. This combination gives the ATL-800 camera a 10-month battery
                                                life, making it an important video recording device for this project.
                                                Afidus ATL-800 engineering Timelapse Camera is the first camera in the
                                                world with a battery life of up to 2 months, which has been well
                                                received by the industry in both marketing and global sales. However,
                                                in real-world engineering applications, users are looking forward to a
                                                further increase in the camera's endurance. O2O has introduced two IPX7
                                                rated waterproof battery packs (2.6x power and 4x power), which
                                                are connected via the ATL-800's built-in waterproof USB port,
                                                dramatically increasing the camera's battery life. Now with a battery
                                                life of up to 7.2 months or even up to 10 months, the ATL-800 has once
                                                again established itself as a global leader. The use of the ATL-800 4K
                                                Timelapse Camera and the application of O2O's exclusive technology
                                                brings great convenience and benefits to engineering photographers
                                                and professional users. Whether shooting the Kaohsiung Jiuru Bridge
                                                demolition project or other engineering fields, the ATL-800's
                                                outstanding performance will bring a new revolution in video recording.

                                            <P>The Kaohsiung City Government's Sports Development Program is once again
                                                leading the wave of sustainable development, this time partnering with
                                                Woven International Energy Group to document the solar photovoltaic
                                                projects at the Kaohsiung Youth Basketball Arena and Fung Sai Badminton
                                                Stadium by using high-profile Afidus time-lapse cameras. The Kaohsiung
                                                City Government has been actively promoting the use of renewable
                                                energy, especially in sports facilities. Recently, the Kaohsiung Youth
                                                Basketball Court and Fung Sai Badminton Stadium solar photovoltaic
                                                projects, contracted by Wo Sing International Energy Group, have
                                                been successfully completed. These two important green energy projects
                                                have attracted widespread attention from the industry. To ensure that
                                                these critical projects are perfectly documented for future reference,
                                                Woven International chose the highly acclaimed Afidus time-lapse camera,
                                                a professional photographic tool that is known for its superior
                                                performance and reliability, and has been utilized in construction
                                                and engineering projects around the globe. The Kaohsiung City
                                                Government's Sports Development Program has been working to provide
                                                modern sports facilities while reducing reliance on traditional energy
                                                sources.
                                                These two projects, both located in Kaohsiung, are important components
                                                of the city's sports infrastructure. They not only provide quality
                                                sports venues, but also actively contribute to the field of sustainable
                                                development. The successful contracting of Woven International Energy
                                                Group has made these solar photovoltaic projects a reality and added a
                                                new dimension to Kaohsiung's environmentally friendly sports venues,
                                                with the use of Afidus time-lapse cameras ensuring that every critical
                                                moment is perfectly captured. The success of these projects is not only
                                                important for the development of sports and the use of renewable
                                                energy in Kaohsiung, but also highlights the indispensable role of
                                                Afidus time-lapse cameras in helping to document key projects and
                                                programs. We look forward to seeing more sustainable projects like this
                                                in the future, and expect Afidus time-lapse cameras to continue to play
                                                their unique role in these projects.

                                            <P>The renovation project of the Shen Want Hotel will be newly presented
                                                through 4K project time-lapse photography, and the Afidus ATL-800 4K
                                                expert time-lapse camera will be used for this record. As one of the
                                                Group's milestone projects, the importance of the renovation of the Shen
                                                Want Hotel cannot be overlooked, and after in-depth evaluation by the
                                                professional photographers within the Want Want Group, it was
                                                decided to use the Afidus ATL-800 4K expert time-lapse camera to record
                                                the entire project. We would like to thank our clients for their trust
                                                in OCTO's engineering time-lapse photography consultants and
                                                highly commend and support their professional choice. The era of 4K
                                                project time-lapse photography has arrived, and this advanced technology
                                                will greatly enhance the quality of project recording. Over the
                                                past few years, time-lapse photography of construction projects has been
                                                carried out over a long period of time, but now, by introducing 4K
                                                time-lapse camera recording, we will be able to show this long
                                                construction process with higher resolution and richer details. The
                                                price difference between a 4K and a 1080p time-lapse camera is small
                                                relative to the price of the equipment, only about USD330. However,
                                                for a project that has taken years to document, the price difference is
                                                negligible. Considering the cost of time and the ability to market this
                                                milestone project with high-resolution 4K images for years
                                                to come, choosing 4K time-lapse photography is a wise decision. Afidus
                                                looks forward to capturing every moment of the Shen Wang Hotel
                                                renovation project with the help of the Afidus ATL-800 4K Expert

                                                also proves once again the professionalism and superiority of Afidus'

                                                Curious about whether these two different camera models were
                                                for the same project, the construction firm made a phone call to
                                                inquire. The response was affirmative, confirming that both camera
                                                models were indeed intended for use in the same engineering project.
                                                Regarding
                                                the decision to simultaneously utilize 4K and 1080p timelapse cameras,
                                                the construction firm explained that this restoration project involves
                                                preserving historical monuments, which demands meticulous attention
                                                to detail. Consequently, the supervisory authority specified the use of
                                                Afidus timelapse cameras to document the entire restoration process
                                                comprehensively and precisely. "We extend our gratitude to Taiwan

                                                long-term application of 4K Timelapse in everyday life represents a
                                                fresh and innovative field. The decision to adopt the professional
                                                Afidus
                                                ATL-800 camera in this context can be attributed to the following
                                                reasons: Extended Recording Duration: Conventional 4K cameras often have
                                                a recording time limit of 2-3 hours, necessitating the use of external
                                                power sources to extend the duration. However, it has been observed that
                                                cameras tend to overheat and experience system failures during prolonged
                                                usage, particularly in the case of 4K action cameras available
                                                in the market. The ATL-800 camera, on the other hand, boasts a maximum
                                                battery life of two months and remains operational even when connected
                                                to an external power supply. Optical Zoom Capability: The ATL-800
                                                camera features optical zoom, enabling full-frame composition and
                                                enhancing the artistic quality of the captured footage. Close Proximity
                                                Timelapse: The ATL-800 camera offers the unique capability to capture
                                                Timelapse sequences from distances as close as 1cm to 40cm, a range that
                                                is unattainable with standard wide-angle Timelapse cameras that lack the
                                                ability to focus on subjects in close proximity. User-Friendly
                                                App Features: The ATL-800 camera's accompanying app allows for the
                                                "hanging hook" shooting mode, ensuring that dates displayed in the
                                                footage are not reversed, thereby enhancing convenience and accuracy.
                                                Automated MP4 Output: The ATL-800 camera automatically generates MP4
                                                videos, eliminating the need for manual integration of individual
                                                photos, which is typically required in the Timelapse mode of standard
                                                4K cameras. The superior performance and functionality of the Afidus
                                                ATL-800 4K time lapse camera makes it the tool of choice in the field of
                                                art creation. This innovative technology will open up more possibilities
                                                for artists and enrich their creative expression, while the viewer will
