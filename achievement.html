                                            <P>In July 2024, the National Palace Museum became one of the first organisations to use the latest launched Afidus ATL230 project timelapse camera for project monitoring. The camera, marketed by O2O, is packed with innovative features that have been well recognised by customers. Its features such as ‘Ladder-free’, ‘Intelligent Connection to Mobile Power’ and ‘Image Comparison and Anti-Walking’ enable users to easily set up and operate the camera without complicated adjustments, which brings a revolutionary change to the monitoring of project progress.

                                                The new camera's wireless ladder-free function is particularly outstanding, allowing users to check the camera status, download image files, modify parameters, and access the files within 10 to 15 metres at any time via the APP when set up at high locations such as streetlights. Whether filming site progress or capturing critical moments, the Afidus ATL230 demonstrates its efficiency and convenience, providing more comprehensive engineering documentation and analysis support.

                                                chose the Afidus ATL-800 4K time-lapse camera, which is a new trend in
                                                construction technology. The renovation of this office building is

                                            <P>In the past, ATL-800 was mainly used in private projects, however, with
                                                the advancement of 4K technology, more and more public projects have
                                                begun to take 4K resolution as an important part of the bid
                                                specification.
                                                This case is one of the highlights in the optimization and improvement
                                                project of Lotte Taoyuan Baseball Stadium in Taoyuan City. An imaging
                                                company used two sets of Afidus ATL-800 expert project timelapse
                                                cameras to capture all phases of the project, presenting the full
                                                picture of the project with high-definition recordings. The owner of the
                                                award-winning imaging company went to Afidus distributor O2O in
                                                person to pick up the camera and received comprehensive educational
                                                support, which also represents a new trend in the application and
                                                adoption of professional 4K engineering timelapse cameras in the field
                                                of public works. Through the excellent performance of ATL-800, the
                                                recordings of public works will be more accurate and clear, bringing
                                                better visual experience. As the world's first professional 4K project
                                                timelapse camera, the Afidus ATL-800 breaks through and opens the 4K era
                                                of public works recording. In addition to the high quality 4K
                                                resolution, this camera also has the following unique advantages:
                                                Built-in
                                                triple optical zoom function to accurately optimize the composition of
                                                the project record, not only to provide greater flexibility, so that
                                                owners are no longer limited to the general market pure wide-angle
                                                version of the timelapse camera. Built-in Image Comparison Function:
                                                Even if the angle is shifted accidentally, the image comparison function
                                                of the APP can quickly and accurately adjust the image so that
                                                the recordings can be returned to their original appearance. Solve the
                                                problem of battery life: The power consumption of 4K sensors is a common
                                                problem in the market, however, the ATL-800 camera is equipped
                                                with a battery life of up to 2 months, and can be connected to a

                                            <P>With the increasing popularity of public works projects, 4K time-lapse
                                                photography has become the latest focus, and the ATL-800 4K project
                                                Timelapse Camera has attracted a great deal of attention in the video
                                                industry in the past year since its launch. In the past, it was commonly
                                                used in private construction projects, but this year, it has started to
                                                gradually enter into the scenes of public projects, such as
                                                the National Palace Museum, Taoyuan Airport T3 Terminal Office Building,
                                                etc., and the use of Kaohsiung Jiu Ru Bridge demolition project has
                                                demonstrated the trend of popularization of 4K time-lapse photography.
                                                This project is especially noteworthy. In addition to purchasing the
                                                ATL-800 project version of the Timelapse Camera, the customer also
                                                purchased a special 4x power USB waterproof battery box kit made by
                                                O2O, which contains a number of original Panasonic 18650 lithium
                                                batteries. This combination gives the ATL-800 camera a 10-month battery
                                                life, making it an important video recording device for this project.
                                                Afidus ATL-800 engineering Timelapse Camera is the first camera in the
                                                world with a battery life of up to 2 months, which has been well
                                                received by the industry in both marketing and global sales. However,
                                                in real-world engineering applications, users are looking forward to a
                                                further increase in the camera's endurance. O2O has introduced two IPX7
                                                rated waterproof battery packs (2.6x power and 4x power), which
                                                are connected via the ATL-800's built-in waterproof USB port,
                                                dramatically increasing the camera's battery life. Now with a battery
                                                life of up to 7.2 months or even up to 10 months, the ATL-800 has once
                                                again established itself as a global leader. The use of the ATL-800 4K
                                                Timelapse Camera and the application of O2O's exclusive technology
                                                brings great convenience and benefits to engineering photographers
                                                and professional users. Whether shooting the Kaohsiung Jiuru Bridge
                                                demolition project or other engineering fields, the ATL-800's
                                                outstanding performance will bring a new revolution in video recording.

                                                District was successfully documented with an Afidus ATL-800 4K Timelapse
                                                Camera, achieving excellent photographic results. Although the
                                                project site is surrounded by tall buildings, with the optical zoom
                                                function of the ATL-800, the photographer easily realized the full-page
                                                composition desired by the client. Typical 4K Timelapse Cameras
                                                are usually equipped only with wide-angle lenses, which can result in

                                                leading the wave of sustainable development, this time partnering with
                                                Woven International Energy Group to document the solar photovoltaic
                                                projects at the Kaohsiung Youth Basketball Arena and Fung Sai Badminton
                                                Stadium by using high-profile Afidus time-lapse cameras. The Kaohsiung
                                                City Government has been actively promoting the use of renewable
                                                energy, especially in sports facilities. Recently, the Kaohsiung Youth

                                                projects, contracted by Wo Sing International Energy Group, have
                                                been successfully completed. These two important green energy projects
                                                have attracted widespread attention from the industry. To ensure that
                                                these critical projects are perfectly documented for future reference,
                                                Woven International chose the highly acclaimed Afidus time-lapse camera,
                                                a professional photographic tool that is known for its superior
                                                performance and reliability, and has been utilized in construction
                                                and engineering projects around the globe. The Kaohsiung City
                                                Government's Sports Development Program has been working to provide
                                                modern sports facilities while reducing reliance on traditional energy
                                                sources.
                                                These two projects, both located in Kaohsiung, are important components
                                                of the city's sports infrastructure. They not only provide quality
                                                sports venues, but also actively contribute to the field of sustainable
                                                development. The successful contracting of Woven International Energy
                                                Group has made these solar photovoltaic projects a reality and added a
                                                new dimension to Kaohsiung's environmentally friendly sports venues,
                                                with the use of Afidus time-lapse cameras ensuring that every critical
                                                moment is perfectly captured. The success of these projects is not only
                                                important for the development of sports and the use of renewable
                                                energy in Kaohsiung, but also highlights the indispensable role of
                                                Afidus time-lapse cameras in helping to document key projects and
                                                programs. We look forward to seeing more sustainable projects like this
                                                in the future, and expect Afidus time-lapse cameras to continue to play
                                                their unique role in these projects.

                                            <P>The renovation project of the Shen Want Hotel will be newly presented

                                                expert time-lapse camera will be used for this record. As one of the
                                                Group's milestone projects, the importance of the renovation of the Shen
                                                Want Hotel cannot be overlooked, and after in-depth evaluation by the
                                                professional photographers within the Want Want Group, it was
                                                decided to use the Afidus ATL-800 4K expert time-lapse camera to record
                                                the entire project. We would like to thank our clients for their trust
                                                in OCTO's engineering time-lapse photography consultants and
                                                highly commend and support their professional choice. The era of 4K
                                                project time-lapse photography has arrived, and this advanced technology
                                                will greatly enhance the quality of project recording. Over the
                                                past few years, time-lapse photography of construction projects has been
                                                carried out over a long period of time, but now, by introducing 4K
                                                time-lapse camera recording, we will be able to show this long
                                                construction process with higher resolution and richer details. The
                                                price difference between a 4K and a 1080p time-lapse camera is small
                                                relative to the price of the equipment, only about USD330. However,
                                                for a project that has taken years to document, the price difference is
                                                negligible. Considering the cost of time and the ability to market this
                                                milestone project with high-resolution 4K images for years
                                                to come, choosing 4K time-lapse photography is a wise decision. Afidus

                                            <P>Kaohsiung City Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau has opted for Afidus
                                                ATL-800 and ATL-200S timelapse cameras to record the entire restoration
                                                process of the cultural landscape Ganshan Xing Village monument.
                                                As per the client's instructions, the project was specifically
                                                designated to use Afidus ATL-800 and ATL-200S for time-lapse
                                                photography, a decision supported by the supervisory authority. One day,
                                                a construction
                                                firm placed an order on the official website of Afidus authorized dealer
                                                O2O, purchasing one set each of ATL-800 and ATL-200S timelapse cameras.
                                                Curious about whether these two different camera models were
                                                for the same project, the construction firm made a phone call to
                                                inquire. The response was affirmative, confirming that both camera
                                                models were indeed intended for use in the same engineering project.
                                                Regarding
                                                the decision to simultaneously utilize 4K and 1080p timelapse cameras,
                                                the construction firm explained that this restoration project involves
                                                preserving historical monuments, which demands meticulous attention
                                                to detail. Consequently, the supervisory authority specified the use of
                                                Afidus timelapse cameras to document the entire restoration process
                                                comprehensively and precisely. "We extend our gratitude to Taiwan

                                            <P>In addition to its prevalent use in engineering documentation, the
                                                long-term application of 4K Timelapse in everyday life represents a
                                                fresh and innovative field. The decision to adopt the professional
                                                Afidus
                                                ATL-800 camera in this context can be attributed to the following
                                                reasons: Extended Recording Duration: Conventional 4K cameras often have
                                                a recording time limit of 2-3 hours, necessitating the use of external
                                                power sources to extend the duration. However, it has been observed that
                                                cameras tend to overheat and experience system failures during prolonged
                                                usage, particularly in the case of 4K action cameras available
                                                in the market. The ATL-800 camera, on the other hand, boasts a maximum
                                                battery life of two months and remains operational even when connected
                                                to an external power supply. Optical Zoom Capability: The ATL-800
                                                camera features optical zoom, enabling full-frame composition and
                                                enhancing the artistic quality of the captured footage. Close Proximity
                                                Timelapse: The ATL-800 camera offers the unique capability to capture
                                                Timelapse sequences from distances as close as 1cm to 40cm, a range that
                                                is unattainable with standard wide-angle Timelapse cameras that lack the
                                                ability to focus on subjects in close proximity. User-Friendly
                                                App Features: The ATL-800 camera's accompanying app allows for the
                                                "hanging hook" shooting mode, ensuring that dates displayed in the
                                                footage are not reversed, thereby enhancing convenience and accuracy.
                                                Automated MP4 Output: The ATL-800 camera automatically generates MP4
                                                videos, eliminating the need for manual integration of individual
                                                photos, which is typically required in the Timelapse mode of standard
                                                4K cameras. The superior performance and functionality of the Afidus
                                                ATL-800 4K time lapse camera makes it the tool of choice in the field of
                                                art creation. This innovative technology will open up more possibilities
                                                for artists and enrich their creative expression, while the viewer will
                                                be able to see clearly the process of a work from scratch, bringing art
                                                closer to us.

                                            <P>Global Life Insurance Company's new headquarters construction project is
                                                now using the 4K Afidus ATL-800 construction time-lapse camera to
                                                capture important milestones. On May 2nd, a neighboring building near
                                                the construction site in Taipei installed the Afidus ATL-800 Pro 4K
                                                camera, with support from Gnanalan Video Production Company. More and
                                                more corporate headquarters are adopting 4K time-lapse recording,
                                                making it an increasingly popular method for capturing construction
                                                progress. Gnanalan Video Production Company was responsible for
                                                installing the Afidus ATL-800 Pro camera and providing training
                                                services.
                                                The camera set was purchased by Gnanalan Video Production Co., Ltd. The
                                                time-lapse photography captured will document the new construction
                                                project at the Global Life Insurance Company headquarters. This
                                                use of advanced technology in construction monitoring is a sign of the
                                                increasing importance of precise and detailed documentation of progress
                                                in the industry. The adoption of the Afidus ATL-800 Pro camera
                                                demonstrates the growing trend of using 4K time-lapse recording to
                                                provide a comprehensive record of construction activities.
